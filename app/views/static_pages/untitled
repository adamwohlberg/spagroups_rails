During their Membership term (as described in the section entitled “Duration” above), Member authorizes SpaGroups&trade; to negotiate and accept a travel agent commission for all goods and services associated with any and all bookings made by or for Member at a SpaGroups&trade; advertised Supplier including but not limited to Miraval™, Red Mountain Spa Resort™, The Oaks at Ojai™, Lake Austin Spa Resort™ and Rancho La Puerta™, regardless of whether the booking is for an individual or a group, as long as the booking is made subsequent to the date Member initially joins SpaGroups&trade; as a Premium Member. This exclusive agency provision applies to all bookings made by Member as well as all bookings made by any traveler included in any Group contracted between our Suppliers and Member or Member’s representatives or agents.  Member gives SpaGroups&trade; the right to act as the Exclusive Buyer's Agent for Member and all participants of Member’s Group in regards to Suppliers advertised on the Site, and Member recognizes that SpaGroups&trade; is entitled to a commission for all goods and services purchased from Suppliers by Member and the members of their Group of no less than 10% of all rooms revenues earned by the resort associated with Member and Member's Group.
